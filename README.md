# I.-Semester-Exam-Project
Welcome!
I have two pages here: the welcome page and the first playlist page called 'Oh Those Lovely Friday Evenings'. I put a star there to indicate you can click there.
On that page there are some more things that are clickabe: the play button (for which I used JavaScript) and the title in the header (it will take you back to the main page).
Unfortunately, I ran out of time so my website is not finished at all. I am very sorry for that.
Thank you for reading!
